/**
 * Making sure your environment works:
 * One of the most used functions in Javascript is the console.log() function. This function prints a message written between the '(' and ')' to the output terminal/console.
 * Note the following: a function will always follow this format: 'functionname()'. 
 * The assignment below is to make you familiar with using the most common javascript function: console.log and variables.
 */

// This should print the text: 'Lesson01' to the terminal screen.
console.log("Lesson01")

// Feel free to change the text here to something else and see the result.
console.log("change text")

// We can also print numbers to the console:
console.log(10)

// We can also print the value that a variable holds:
const variable1 = "text variable1"
console.log(variable1)

// Feel free to chagne the value here:
const variable2 = "change the text of variable2"
console.log(variable2)
