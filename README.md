| NodeJS  | https://nodejs.org/en/  | 'Popular Javascript runtime environment' |
| Visual studio Code | https://code.visualstudio.com/ |  IDE to develop programs, write code and try the result |

## Cloning the repository
The repository is the current project (https://github.com/FStoeltie/learn_nodejs).
After installing the git tool stated above locally, the current project can be pulled (downloaded) locally to the computer.

This should clone the repository to the directory and a new folder will be created with the name: 'learn_nodejs'.
Navigate to this folder in the command prompt (run: 'cd learn_nodejs').

## Accessing a lesson
To access the lesson run the following command in a terminal in the project directory: 'git checkout lesson_name' - example: 'git checkout lesson01' will switch the project to the lesson01 branch. 

## Running a lesson
To run the program of a lesson, it is required to have NodeJS installed. 
Go to the root directory of the project (../learn_nodejs/) and execute the following command: node server.
This should run the main program - Good luck with the lessons.
